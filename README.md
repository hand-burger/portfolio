# Personal Portfolio Website
<p>Just a little bit of a portfolio website for me and about me.</p>
<p>It was written in pure HTML, js and css, this website houses some information about myself, some projects and a contact page.</p>
<p>I'm not exactly happy with it so i'll probably end up completely scrapping this, but it'll do for now.</p>
