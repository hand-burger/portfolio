# Personal portfolio website
Just a small one page repsponsive website which houses my information
The website was written in pure HTML, JS and most importantly CSS.
I also used a couple of svg images for the waves near the bottom of the page.

In July of 2021, I started with an initial design which I absolutely hated, so just a month later a scrapped that design and made this new one, which I am quite happy with 😄

Feel free to use this website as a template for your own, if proper credit is given of course.
