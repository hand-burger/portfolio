                    <p id='title'>Hamiltonian Snake</p>
                    <p>This odd snake game is not like the others. In this game you are not the player, rather an observer of 
                        this perfectionist snake as it continuously follows a specific generated circuit which is unique with 
                        each game. Behind the scenes, the program is generating a Hamiltonian Circuit which the snake will continuously follow 
                        until it fills out the board. An average full game takes around 6.5 minutes in order to get 400 apples 
                        and to turn into a 20x20 square.
                    </p>

                    <p id='title'>Wired to Bluetooth Headphones</p>
                    <p>So, I conceived the idea for this project in April 2020, bored during quarantine. I was going through old 
                        tech of mine in hopes of finding something to occupy myself with and found that pair of headphones and a 
                        cheap pair of bluetooth headphones, and it struck me, turn those wired headphones into wireless. From there, 
                        I took apart the bluetooth headphones to see how it worked and found the board with the wireless transmitter with 
                        wires going to the speakers. Finally, I de-soldered the wires from the wireless headphones and soldered the wired 
                        headphone wires to the wireless transmitter board and it worked. It was a great opportunity and lesson in headphone hardware.
                    </p>
