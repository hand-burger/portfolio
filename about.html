            <p>Hi! I'm Jack, a high-school student and software developer from a relatively small city in Ontario. 
                At the time of writing this I'm 16 years old (july 2021), currently staying inside during my summer vacation before my 
                senior year of high-school. 
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                My interests extend throughout many different subjects and topics. For one, I would regard myself as an active person, 
                with a passion for biking, playing hockey and ultimately being active. Moreover, I am a big fan of music from all sorts of 
                different genres, it's definitely a very important thing for me. Additionally, I'm quite interested in cars, and more specifically
                the components of vehicles and how they interact together to form a single working machine. Lastly, but most 
                important for me, I am, and have been, extremely interested in computers and programming. I've been exposed to 
                computers for years and grew increasingly more interested in them over the past half decade or so. In my spare time I find myself 
                creating small or large scale projects to become more experienced and comfortable with programing and to solve everyday problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would describe myself as a leading and reliable member of any group or club, with the ability to see a project through 
                to completion. My unique experiences and insight are invaluable to myself and others when achieving a common goal.
                As such, I would personally define myself as a valuable part of a team as an individual.

        <div class='paragraph aspirations'>
            <p>As I am currently in the progress of graduating high-school, I don't know what my future may hold, but I do know what 
                I aspire to achieve career-wise. Ultimately, as many computer science students desire, I aspire to work in Silicon Valley for, 
                naturally, a tech-related company. Obviously, that's easier said than done and to first do that I essentially <em>need</em> 
                to land an internship during university. As such, my current goal is to attend a university which enables and helps me to achieve my
                aspirations. Currently, I plan to apply to the University of Waterloo, McGill and Toronto, in hopes of accomplishing my 
                aspirations.
